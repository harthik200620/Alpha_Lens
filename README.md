## Overview

Alpha Lens is a real-time quant research web application built for the Indian equity market (NSE/BSE). It scrapes live financial news from top-tier Indian sources via RSS feeds, pipes each headline through Google Gemini (prompted as an elite quantitative portfolio manager), and outputs structured trade signals — complete with affected tickers, directional bias (Bullish/Bearish), confidence scores, target prices, and stop-loss levels.

What sets Alpha Lens apart is its **dual-confirmation system**: every AI-generated signal is cross-validated against real-time technical indicators (RSI, SMA, Bollinger Bands, volume analysis) before being surfaced to the user. A background worker thread continuously monitors open positions using yfinance, automatically resolving trades as winners, losers, or expired based on asymmetric risk/reward thresholds.

Starting with **v4.0**, Alpha Lens introduces a **Multi-Model Ensemble Prediction Engine** — five independent rule-based models that analyze each headline from different angles (sentiment depth, historical similarity, sector momentum, and event patterns). A signal is only emitted when the ensemble score meets a minimum threshold (>= 70) **and** at least 3 out of 5 models agree, dramatically reducing false positives.

The platform also ships with a full **backtesting engine** that replays historical news headlines against past market data to measure the AI's predictive accuracy over time, along with a **backfill utility** for reprocessing existing database entries through the updated ensemble pipeline.

---

## Key Features

- **Live Market Ticker** — Real-time price tracking for NIFTY 50, SENSEX, BANK NIFTY, and MIDCAP NIFTY via yfinance with automatic % change calculation.

- **AI-Powered News Analysis** — Fetches live headlines from Economic Times, MoneyControl, and LiveMint RSS feeds, then analyzes each through Google Gemini 2.5 Flash with a quantitative finance prompt to extract actionable trade signals.

- **Multi-Model Ensemble Prediction** — Five independent models (Sentiment Depth, Historical Similarity, Sector Momentum, Event Pattern, and a weighted ensemble aggregator) cross-validate every signal. Only predictions with high ensemble agreement are surfaced, reducing noise and false positives.

- **Technical Confirmation Layer** — Every AI signal is validated against 60-day technical indicators including RSI (14-period), SMA (20/50-day), Bollinger Band positioning, volume trends, and overall market regime detection before being accepted.

- **Fuzzy Duplicate Detection** — Incoming news headlines are compared against the 50 most recent entries using sequence-matching similarity (threshold: 75%), preventing near-duplicate articles from generating redundant signals.

- **Confidence-Gated Filtering** — Only signals meeting a minimum confidence threshold (default: 65%) are surfaced. The AI assigns realistic scores: 85+ for crystal-clear catalysts, 65–84 for strong probable signals.

- **Autonomous Price Re-evaluation** — A background yfinance worker thread monitors all active positions every 10 seconds, checking against asymmetric profit targets (+1%) and stop-losses (-2%), automatically resolving trades with time-based expiry.

- **Historical Backtesting** — Bulk-processes a CSV of past news headlines against historical candle data, evaluating AI predictions at T+24h and T+48h with configurable target (+1.5%) and stop-loss (-3.0%) thresholds.

- **Backfill Utility** — Reprocesses all existing headlines in the database through the updated ensemble engine, regenerating stock impact entries with the latest prediction pipeline.

- **Performance Reporting** — Generates terminal-based performance reports with win rate, average confidence of winners vs. losers, and breakdowns by trade status (Active, Hit Target, Stopped Out, Expired).

- **OTP Authentication** — Secure email-based passwordless login using SendGrid with 6-digit OTP codes and 10-minute expiry windows.

- **Google OAuth Sign-In** — One-click authentication via Google accounts with automatic user provisioning.

- **SQLite User Management** — Lightweight persistent user database with hashed passwords and session-based authentication.

## Multi-Model Ensemble Prediction Engine

Alpha Lens v4.0 introduces a sophisticated ensemble system in `prediction_models.py` that runs every headline through **five independent models** before emitting a signal:

| # | Model | Class | Description |
|---|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | **Sentiment Depth** | `SentimentDepthModel` | Analyzes headline sentiment intensity — keyword strength, negation detection, percentage modifiers, and graded bullish/bearish vocabulary. |
| 2 | **Historical Similarity** | `HistoricalSimilarityModel` | Compares the current headline against a cache of previously seen headlines and their outcomes, scoring based on pattern similarity. |
| 3 | **Sector Momentum** | `SectorMomentumModel` | Maps affected tickers to their sectors and evaluates sector-level momentum using a sector classification map and momentum cache. |
| 4 | **Event Pattern** | `EventPatternModel` | Detects specific market-moving event types (earnings, mergers, regulatory changes, etc.) using pattern-matched rules and assigns directional scores. |
| 5 | **Ensemble Aggregator** | `EnsemblePredictor` | Collects weighted scores from all four models, computes a final ensemble score, and applies a dual gate: **score >= 70 AND 3+ models must agree** on direction. |

This dual-gate approach ensures that only high-conviction, multi-perspective signals reach the dashboard, significantly improving signal quality over single-model approaches.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- A [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) key (used in legacy/prototype mode)
- A [Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/) API key (one or more for key rotation)
- A [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) API key with a verified sender identity
- A Google OAuth 2.0 Client ID (for Google sign-in)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/KIRITO-899/Alpha_Lens.git
cd Alpha_Lens

# Install dependencies
pip install flask requests google-genai yfinance sendgrid feedparser pytz
```

---

## Configuration

### 1. Gemini API Keys (`app.py` and `backtest.py`)

Replace the placeholder API keys in the `API_KEYS` list with your own Google Gemini keys. Multiple keys enable automatic rotation to avoid rate limits.

```python
API_KEYS = [
    "your_gemini_api_key_1",
    "your_gemini_api_key_2",
]
```

### 2. SendGrid (`database.py`)

Replace the SendGrid API key and update the verified sender email address.

```python
SENDGRID_API_KEY = 'your_sendgrid_api_key'
# Update from_email to your verified SendGrid sender
```

### 3. Google OAuth (`index.html`)

Update the Google OAuth Client ID in the frontend HTML file for Google sign-in functionality.

---

## Usage

### Running the App

```bash
python app.py
```

This starts the Flask server along with two background worker threads:

- **AI News Engine** — Continuously scrapes RSS feeds, analyzes headlines with Gemini, runs them through the multi-model ensemble predictor, applies technical confirmation, and stores results in `news_cache.db`. Fuzzy duplicate detection prevents near-identical headlines from generating redundant signals.

### Running the background workers automatically on Windows

A worker-only mode is available so the data collector can run without the web UI.

1. Create the startup shortcut by running the PowerShell helper from the repo root:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File setup_windows_startup.ps1
```

2. The helper creates a shortcut in your Windows Startup folder that runs:

```bat
run_alpha_lens_workers.bat
```

3. This starts the Alpha Lens background workers automatically when you sign in.

If you want to run the workers manually instead of using startup automation:

```bash
python backend/app.py --workers-only
```

- **yfinance Price Worker** — Monitors all active trade positions every 10 seconds, checking if targets or stop-losses have been hit.

Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### Running the Backtester

```bash
python backtest.py
```

The backtesting engine reads from `news_dataset.csv` (columns: `Datetime`, `Headline`) and evaluates AI predictions against real historical candle data with the following parameters:

- **Target**: +1.5% profit
- **Stop-Loss**: -3.0%
- **Evaluation Windows**: T+24h and T+48h after news publication
- **Minimum Confidence**: 65%

Sample output includes a full statistics report with total signals analyzed, win/loss breakdown, hit rates by conviction level, and average P&L.

### Running the Backfill Utility

Backfill is exposed as a one-time, manual **admin API endpoint** (it was refactored
out of the old standalone `backfill_stocks.py` script):

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/admin/backfill-pending-predictions" \
  -H "X-Alpha-Lens-Token: <admin_token>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"limit": 64}'
```

Reprocesses news headlines marked `ai_status='pending'` through the updated ensemble engine, generating fresh `stock_impact` entries using the latest prediction pipeline. Poll the same endpoint with `GET` (and the admin token) to watch progress.

---

---

## Backtesting Engine

The backtester (`backtest.py`) is a standalone module that replays historical headlines through the same AI + technical analysis pipeline used in the live app. For each headline it:

1. Queries Gemini for a structured trade signal (ticker, direction, confidence, reasoning).
2. Fetches historical technical indicators (RSI, SMA, Bollinger position) at the time the news was published.
3. Applies a trade filter combining AI confidence and technical agreement.
4. Scans subsequent 1-minute and daily candles to determine if the target (+1.5%) or stop-loss (-3.0%) was hit within 24–48 hours.
5. Aggregates results into a comprehensive statistics report.

The system uses asymmetric risk/reward thresholds — a wider stop-loss gives trades breathing room while maintaining a favorable target.

---

## Performance Reporting

The `performance_report.py` module connects to `news_cache.db` and generates real-time performance metrics:

- Total news articles processed and unique stock signals generated
- Breakdown by status: Active View, Hit Target, Stopped Out, Expired
- Win rate calculated on resolved trades only (excluding active and expired)
- Average confidence comparison: winning trades vs. losing trades
- Color-coded terminal output for quick visual assessment

## Security Notice

> ✅ **Secrets are loaded from environment variables** (`.env` locally, the Render
> dashboard in production) — never hardcoded in source. `.env` is gitignored; if you
> fork this repo, set your own keys in your own `.env` and never commit it.
>
> ⚠️ **If you cloned/forked this repo before this commit:** earlier history contained
> committed secrets. Treat any key seen in the git history as compromised and rotate it
> (regenerate a fresh key in the provider console) — removing a key from a public repo
> does not un-expose it.

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY_1=your_key
export GEMINI_API_KEY_2=your_key
export SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_key
export GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
export FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` (already configured) and update the source files to read from `os.environ`.

---

## Notes & Limitations

- **Market Hours** — yfinance returns the last available closing price outside of NSE/BSE trading hours (9:15 AM – 3:30 PM IST). Live signals are most accurate during active market sessions.
- **RSS Feed Rate Limits** — The news engine scrapes from free RSS feeds which may occasionally return cached or slightly delayed headlines.
- **Gemini API Quotas** — The system implements automatic API key rotation across multiple keys to handle rate limits. If all keys are exhausted, it will retry after a cooldown period.
- **Backtesting Trade Rules** — 1.5% profit target, 3.0% stop-loss, evaluated at T+24h and T+48h windows after news publication.
- **Technical Analysis** — Uses 60-day lookback for indicator calculation. RSI (14-period), SMA (20/50-day), Bollinger Bands (20-day, 2σ), and volume trend analysis.
- **Ensemble Gating** — The multi-model ensemble requires a score >= 70 and agreement from at least 3 out of 5 models. This reduces signal volume but improves overall accuracy.
